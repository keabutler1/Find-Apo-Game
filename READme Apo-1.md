### A Backlog
 A major hurdle that I fasted was to make the timer function and the pieces move simultaneosly. Also implementing two players and a scoreboard was challenging. I also noticed that the Vilian images are staying in the correct place after selecting Apo. I had a difficult time figuring that out.
